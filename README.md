## Description

As a marketing agency we were given the task of refactoring a webpage for Horiseon with the key focus on improving web **accessibility** and **search engine optimization**.

### What Was Done

- Throughout document HTML elements were changed to semantic HTML elements.
- In the header the broken navigation link was fixed and the title was updated.
- Throughout HTML document img tags were given an alt attribute.
- A closing img tag error was removed.
- The HTML document and CSS stylesheet code were formatted using lint (prettier).
- Repeating CSS was consolidated.
- The CSS stylesheet was reordered to roughly follow HTML document layout.
- The type selectors p and a were moved to higher up the stylesheet as these elements appear throughout the HTML document to make it easier for any future developer to target them.

In the future the website could be improved by making it more dynamic and responsive.

## Getting Started

- Clone GitHub project (repository homeworks_01) to your local machine.
- Navigate into project and open in VSCode.
- Open the index.html file in broswer preferably.
